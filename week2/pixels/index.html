        Artist Statement: I chose to use this image becasue of its contemporary cultural value and my recent encounters with individuals who share the same name as me - hence bringing the image into mind and making me relate to it even more. The image is of two identical-looking Spidermans poinintng their index fingers at one another, alluding that they look similar, but they are not the same. Due to its popularity (both initial and overtime) the imgae has had many edits made to it to fit the context of a given caption making it a memorable meme. For this project, I'm using the image on its own without any captions. The image itself is from a scene in the 1967 Spiderman cartoon series . Within online and offline ccommunitities the image has become very popular. So much so that it was recreate in the recent Spiderman film "Spider-man: No Way Home."" As, I mentioned the image has been turned into a meme time and time again and I've used myself within my community over the years. It's rare for a meme to stick around for more than a few months, but according to Charles Raymond in their ScreenRant article, "The Origin of the Spider-man meme," the Spiderman image and meme has been around since 2011 - making it part of my adolescents and my present moment - soldifying it as a familiar media reference for many and myself.
