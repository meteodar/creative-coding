        My bounce is of the four recent Charlie XCX albums. She is a musician for her hyperpop, futuristic, and lush aesthetic and sound. The cover art of her most recent project "brat" has taken the internet by storm due to its much awaited release and its awarness of contemporary trends and "iconic" simplicity. the artist rebranded her past projects to match the style of her recent release. I decided to capture that with this bounce exercise.
